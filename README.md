# Event-it

Event-it is an application that connects users to community-created events. Upon creating an account, a user may either create their own event or register and sign up for events owned by other users. <br/>

User registration, login, and security are provided by Firebase Authentication. 

Events are searchable through either Location keywords or Tagged keywords, depending on toggle.

Locations are populated in a dropdown box via the Google Geocode API.

##  Installation

Two sets of packages must be installed, one for the Server backend, and one for the Frontend.
```
cd server 
npm install --save 
cd .. 
cd frontend 
npm install --save 
```
## Usage

In one terminal in /server, run: </br>
```
npm run seed 
npm start
```
The user can also manually navigate to http://localhost:3000, as this application is best viewed in Chrome.

On the homepage (http://localhost:3000) there is a Search bar and Create Event button centrally located.

## Log-in

Note that clicking the Event button displays an error message: Login or Create Account is required. 

Both Login and Sign Up are in the upper right-hand corner. Sign Up properly detects if an email is already in use. 

Logging in takes the user back to the homepage, where the user will see three new buttons in the upper right-hand corner: My Profile, All Events, and Sign Out. 

The My Profile button takes users to their profile, which lists relevant identification information as well as a list of all Events owned by that user. 

## Events

A user can now create an event with the Create Event button. The new pop-up has error checking for invalid dates and times. The Address field is populated by Google Geocode API. 

Events can be seen by scrolling down on the homepage or by clicking the All Events button in the upper right-hand corner while logged in. 

While viewing an Event that is not owned by the user, that user may Register for that event.

While viewing an Event that is owned by the user, that user may Update the Event. 

## Searching

Events can be searched for based on either Location or by Keywords by toggling the switch in the upper left-hand corner. Locations utilize the Google Geocode API for matching.
